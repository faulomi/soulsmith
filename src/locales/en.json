    "A1Description_01": "Listening Service and Mindfulness Practice is a service that provides a safe space for individuals to utilize as a supportive and cathartic environment. It allows service recipients to express and process their thoughts alongside being heard, without the need to disclose their identity.",
    "A1Description_02": "Listening Service and Mindfulness Practice is suitable for individuals experiencing stress, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, needing understanding, desiring a high level of privacy but wanting someone to listen, or seeking a listener and feeling unable to talk to those around them.",


    "A2Description_01": "Counselling Service is a service that provides advice to explore possibilities or seek solutions to navigate through specific challenges. It emphasizes a guided or expert-recommended process.",
    "A2Description_02": "Counselling Service is suitable for individuals seeking guidance, advice, or direction in resolving life challenges.",


    "A3Description_01" : "Psychotherapy is a profound process that delves into the thoughts, emotions, social interactions, and lifestyle of the service recipient to gain understanding and facilitate behavioral changes. Psychotherapy is an ongoing and consistent process that requires regularity over an extended period, such as three months or even more than a decade. The frequency of sessions ranges from weekly to every three weeks, depending on individual needs, goals, and self-working abilities. Breaks from the therapy process are agreed upon mutually and occur periodically in alignment with the individual's needs and the agreement between the recipient and the expert.",

    "A3Description_02" : "Psychotherapy is suitable for individuals seeking to adjust their personalities, change thought patterns, and cope with recurring problems. It is beneficial for those who feel burnt out, lack motivation in life, desire collaborative decision-making regarding life choices, seek self-understanding, aim to heal emotional wounds, or experience challenges with family members. This service is applicable to all age groups, including children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly.",

    "A4Description_01": "Arts Psychotherapy is a form of psychotherapy that incorporates various art forms as a means of communication during the therapeutic process. It is rooted in the foundational principles of psychotherapy but involves the use of different art disciplines as mediums in the therapeutic process. The nature of art allows the recipient to transcend the limitations of spoken language, which may not fully encapsulate emotions or mental states. Moreover, art can bridge into the subconscious mind more effectively than verbal language and provide a safe space for the recipient to work with their mind.",

    "A4Description_02": "Arts Psychotherapy is Suitable for Children, preteens, teenagers, adults, and the elderly seeking self-understanding or understanding of others, individuals with low self-esteem, those wanting someone to comprehend their emotions, thoughts, and behaviours, those exploring possibilities for life direction, seeking solutions to existing problems, enhancing relationship skills, emotional awareness, and analytical thinking, feeling stressed, anxious, or detached, needing emotional healing and understanding.",

    "A5Description_01": "Therapeutic Workshop is a psychotherapy that enhances skills in managing various aspects of life, such as problem-solving, relationship management, and self-management through understanding. It emphasizes problem analysis and solving and exploring a safe, non-judgmental inner space. The process involves dialogue, working through various art forms, asking questions, engaging in bodily movements, learning psychological techniques, and experimentation to deeply comprehend the encountered problems. It aims to find practical solutions guided by a facilitator, who acts as a supportive companion and designs the process. The entire process is built on the foundation of emotional safety, respect for human dignity, and is based on the principles of Human-Relationship, without a therapist-client relationship.",

    "A5Description_02": "Therapeutic Workshop is Suitable for individuals who want to enhance social and emotional skills, undergo self-transformation, gain insight into areas for personal development, experiment with different communication styles and life problem-solving approaches, struggle with emotional management, seek support, aim to address specific challenges, seek to understand their current problems, and desire guidance in coping with certain issues.",

When the body is relaxed and clear, it enhances sharp thinking processes and stability. In some cases, the suitable sound waves can reach deep into muscles, internal organs, or bodily fluid systems, helping promote balanced functioning and circulation of various systems within the body.",
